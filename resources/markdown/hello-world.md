# Hello World!

I'm not sure if this is still a thing, but when I started programming there was kind of a tradition. There was even a saying that you have never started programming if your first program wasn't a Hello World! 
As I'm trying to start a new journey, I thought would be nice starting with the Hello World, to keep tradition and have a good luck!

I always had this thought about knowledge should be shared freely, but never knew how to do so and always had the feeling that I need to learn more to share something to other developers.

Time has passed, I acquired some knowledge through my career and after a few incentives from my lovely wife and some friends, I start thinking: maybe it is time to start sharing some of the things I've learned with anyone who would be interested.

As an Android Engineer, that is the most content I'm going to write about, but that doesn't mean I can't approach others subjects. The idea is to write content for everyone wanting to learn something new. Subjects I would like to talk about like, but not limited to, Dependency Injection, Architecture patterns, `Jetpack Compose`, KMP and others.

I wanna approach more advanced content, and thats gonna be my focus TBH, as it is hard to find advanced content and there are a plenty of content for beginners.

However, it doesnt mean I'm not going to write beginner's content. I'm gonna try making some beginner-friendly content, but I don't want to just rehash what's already in the docs. There's no point in writing something that's already out there, eh? Meaning that the beginner's content will approach the foundation of the content, but trying to go deeper on it.

The goal is to create valuable content and avoid wasting the reader's time with stuff they've already seen elsewhere. That's why I'm planning adding a table of contents to each article so readers can quickly navigate through the content, and a TL;DR section to summarize the key points.

Honestly, I have no idea if that is going to work. I'm not sure how far I'll go with it or if I'm going to enjoy doing it, but fingers crossed that is going to work and I finally can share with everyone what I learned so far!

If you got interested about what I'm going to write here, hold your coffee, tea, whisky or anything you enjoy, sit your self and let's navigate together through this new journey.

I hope you enjoy! See you later!
