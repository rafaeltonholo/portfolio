# Hello World!

Hello there! My name is Rafael Tonholo, and it is amazing to meet you!

I'm a software developer passionate about mobile development for a long
time, I come from Brazil but currently living in Canada. You can hear
more from me [here](/about) if you are interested.

I'm not sure if this is still a thing, but when I started programming there
was kind of a tradition. There was even a saying that you have never started
programming if your first program wasn't a Hello World!
As I'm trying to start a new journey, I thought would be nice starting with
Hello World, keep tradition and have a bit of good luck!

I always had this thought that knowledge should be shared freely, but never 
knew how to do so and always had the feeling that I needed to learn more to 
share something with other developers.

Time has passed, I acquired some knowledge through my career and after a few 
incentives from my lovely wife and some friends, I started thinking: maybe it 
is time to start sharing some of the things I've learned with anyone who would 
be interested.

As an Android Engineer, that is the most content I'm going to write about, but 
that doesn't mean I can't approach other subjects. The idea is to write content 
for everyone wanting to learn something new. Subjects I would like to talk about 
like, but are not limited to, Dependency Injection, Architecture patterns, 
`Jetpack Compose`, KMP and others.

I wanna approach more advanced content, and that's gonna be my focus TBH, as it is 
hard to find advanced content and there is plenty of content for beginners.

However, it doesn't mean I'm not going to write beginner's content. I'm gonna try 
making some beginner-friendly content, but I don't want to just rehash what's already 
in the docs. There's no point in writing something that's already out there, eh? 
Meaning that the beginner's content will approach the foundation of the content, 
but try to go deeper into it.

The goal is to create valuable content and avoid wasting the reader's time with stuff 
they've already seen elsewhere. That's why I'm planning to add a table of contents to 
each article so readers can quickly navigate through the content and a TL;DR section 
to summarize the key points.

Honestly, I have no idea if that is going to work. I'm not sure how far I'll go with 
it or if I'm going to enjoy doing it, but fingers crossed that is going to work and 
I finally can share with everyone what I learned so far!

If you got yourself interested in what I'm going to write here, hold your coffee, 
tea, whisky or anything you enjoy, sit yourself and let's navigate together through 
this new journey.

I hope you enjoy it! See you later!
